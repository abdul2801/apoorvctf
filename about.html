            Hello hackers! We are a group of buttheads from IIIT Kottayam passionate about CTFs. Here, we post about upcoming CTFs organised by us.
        </p>
        <h2 class="active">What is Capture the Flag?</h2>
        <p>
            A capture the flag (CTF) contest is a special kind of cybersecurity competition designed to challenge its participants to solve computer security problems and/or capture and defend computer systems. The game consists of a series of challenges where participants must reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, or do whatever it takes to solve the challenge. The challenges are all set up with the intent of being hacked, making it an excellent, legal way to get hands-on experience.
        </p>
        <h2 class="active">Upcoming CTFs</h2>
